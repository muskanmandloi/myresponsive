<h1>About the signup process</h1>
<p>Mailchimp audiences are single opt-in by default. That means, each time someone fills out and submits your signup form, we'll immediately add them to your Mailchimp audience as a subscribed contact. This makes it easier for people to join your audience, which can be helpful if you're selling a product or capturing customers on the go.</p>

<p>We also offer the double opt-in signup method, which requires email verification. If you've received a high volume of bounces, unsubscribes, or complaints, double opt-in is recommended.</p>

<p>You can change the opt-in settings for an audience with some exceptions for GDPR and compliance reasons. If you want to change your audience’s opt-in method, update an individual audience’s settings. Or, if you have multiple audiences, you can make changes globally on the Opt-In Settings page.</p>

<p>Take a look at these articles to learn more about the signup process.</p>
<p>Logging in is usually used to enter a specific page, website or application, which trespassers cannot see. Once the user is logged in, the login token may be used to track what actions the user has taken while connected to the site. Logging out may be performed explicitly by the user taking some actions, such as entering the appropriate command or clicking a website link label as such. It can also be done implicitly, such as by the user powering off his or her workstation, closing a web browser window, leaving a website, or not refreshing a website within a defined period.</p>

<p>In the case of websites that use cookies to track sessions, when the user logs out, session-only cookies from that site will usually be deleted from the user's computer. In addition, the server invalidates any associations with the session, thereby making any session-handle in the user's cookie store useless. This feature comes in handy if the user is using a public computer or a computer that is using a public wireless connection. As a security precaution, one should not rely on implicit means of logging out of a system, especially not on a public computer; instead, one should explicitly log out and wait for the confirmation that this request has taken place.</p>

<p>Logging out of a computer, when leaving it, is a common security practice preventing unauthorised users from tampering with it. There are also people who choose to have a password-protected screensaver set to activate after some period of inactivity, thereby requiring the user to re-enter his or her login credentials to unlock the screensaver and gain access to the system. There can be different methods of logging in that may be via image, fingerprints, eye scan, password (oral or textual input), etc.</p>
